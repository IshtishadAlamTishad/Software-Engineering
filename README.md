## Project Overview

Electricity is the cornerstone of Bangladesh's economic growth. However, frequent power outages, inefficiencies in distribution, and high transmission losses hinder sustainable development. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the electricity supply chain, this project aims to revolutionize energy management, resulting in a more reliable and efficient electricity supply system.

### Key Objectives:
- **Demand Forecasting**: AI algorithms predict electricity demand with high accuracy, reducing power outages.
- **Grid Optimization**: AI optimizes energy distribution, minimizing transmission losses.
- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Seamless integration of renewable energy into the national grid.
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Real-time grid management for better resilience and faster response to disruptions.

## Features
- AI-based demand forecasting
- Real-time energy distribution optimization
- Renewable energy management
- Automated outage detection and reporting
- Consumer engagement through mobile applications
